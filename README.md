My final project contains the newly edited database, 
one java file for connection( TestConnection.java),
 one java file for login (Login.java) and one java 
file for the Real Estate System (App.java).

To be able to run the code, simply create the new database, then check the connection between the java eclipse and the database.
To run the program run Login.java. The Username: test and Password: password
There are multiple places that the new database should be connected in the App.java. 
I did not have enough time to clean up my code and make it look as nice as I want it 
but if you look for connection,you will find the places to enter the new database.

There are three tables shown: Properties, agents and price.
The ADD, UPDATE,and DELETE buttons will add, update, and delete the properties.
To add or update the data make sure to fill in all the text fields. 
The result should show in the properties table shown on the right.

On the bottom left, Average Square Footage, property count, agent count,
 and average price is recorded based on current data.

When user adds, deletes, or updates the properties database, the property count and average square footage is updated.

Senarios:
This database is designed for Agents and they will be able to see list of properties, list of agents, and list of prices. 
This will allow them to help their clients figure out which is better and also find out how many agents are listed. 
The agents wil be able to add to the properties.
They can also update the properties by filling out the form and to delete they 
should just enter property id.
This will keep the database updated.

Analytical queries:

We can count properties, agents and get averge price and square footage.

We can also see the data available and update it changing the property count and square footage.
